The produced graph might be a valuable tool for traders. The upper_bound and lower_bound indicate
the range of the ratio, while the trigger_alert field provides a threshold value in this turn that
allows it to be notified of a significant move.

Besides that, a trader can draw several insights.
First one, the trader can quickly see the current value of the ratio and compare it according to the
historical average. If the ratio is moving within the range of the upper_bound and lower_bound,
the trader may consider the two variables to be in a typical range. However, if the ratio goes
beyond the upper_bound or lower_bound, the trader can identify when the ratio is moving too far
from the average historical correlation.

Second, the trader can use the upper_bound and lower_bound to identify potential levels and conditions
for the ratio. If the ratio approaches the upper_bound, the trader may expect it will encounter
demand for selling, but if the ratio approaches the lower_bound, the trader may expect it will
collide with interest for buying it.

Third, the trigger_alert field is useful for the trader to be notified when the ratio reaches a
significant level or when it goes through important alterations. All these facts might be an identification
for further browsing and figuring out a cause.

All these together mai aid traders make reasonable trading decisions based on the current state of
the market.
